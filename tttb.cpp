Note: As with my other GitHub projects, I chose not to use 
generative AI tools when creating Type Through the Bible. 
I wanted to learn how to 
perform these tasks in C++ (or in a C++ library) rather than
simply learn how to get an AI tool to create them.

This code also makes extensive use of the following
open-source libraries:

1. Vincent La's CSV parser (https://github.com/vincentlaucsb/csv-parser)
2. CPP-Terminal (https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/cpp-terminal)

In addition, this program uses the Catholic Public Domain Version
of the Bible that Ronald L. Conte put together. This Bible can be
found at https://sacredbible.org/catholic/ I last updated my local
copy of this Bible (whose text does get updated periodically)
around June 10, 2025.

Some relevant notes:
1. I found that, when I tried to mix std::cin and Term::cin,
certain user prompts would work fine the first time around but
then fail again. I think that this may be because the cpp-terminal
library changes default cin settings; for reference,
see https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/cpp-terminal/issues/320 .
To avoid this issue, I simply replaced all std::cin and std::cout
calls with Term::cin and Term::cout, respectively.
However, I then found that Term::cin calls didn't always work
within OSX following typing tests; therefore, I ended up updating
the game so that all input was entered within raw_mode.

2. It also appears that the cpp-terminal library requires
std::endl or std::flush at the end of Term::cout statements rather than '\n';
otherwise, output may not appear.

3. References to 'PPP3' refer to the 3rd Edition of
// Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++
// by Bjarne Stroustrup.

This game is dedicated to my wife, Allie. I am very grateful
for her patience and understanding as I worked to put it 
together! My multiplayer gameplay sessions with her (yes, she 
was kind enough to play it with me) also helped me refine the
code and improve the OSX release.

Blessed Carlo Acutis, pray for us!
