/* C++ Version of Type Through the Bible
(Still a work in progress!)

Link to project's GitHub page:

This code also makes extensive use of the following
open-source libraries:

1. Vincent La's CSV parser (https://github.com/vincentlaucsb/csv-parser)
2. CPP-Terminal (https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/cpp-terminal)

In addition, this program uses the Catholic Public Domain Version
of the Bible that Ronald L. Conte put together. This Bible can be
found at https://sacredbible.org/catholic/ I last updated my local
copy of this Bible (whose text does get updated periodically)
around June 10, 2025.

Some relevant notes:
1. I found that, when I tried to mix std::cin and Term::cin,
certain user prompts would work fine the first time around but
then fail again. I think that this may be because the cpp-terminal
library changes default cin settings; for reference,
see https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/cpp-terminal/issues/320 .
To avoid this issue, I simply replaced all std::cin and std::cout
calls with Term::cin and Term::cout, respectively.

2. It also appears that the cpp-terminal library requires
std::endl at the end of Term::cout statements rather than '\n';
otherwise, output may not appear.

Blessed Carlo Acutis, pray for us!

To dos (very incomplete list)!

    1. Implement an autosave option, at least for single-player
    games, in which files get saved every 5 tests or so. 
    (This will get trickier if you
    implement parts 4 and 5, since you won't have a full copy
    of word and test results to refer to.)

    2. Think about ways to show and analyze stats (ideally using
    C++, but perhaps via Python also)

    3. Consider skipping the process of loading your existing
    word_results data into memory. You won't really need it for
    anything within the program, and by the time you type through
    the whole Bible, this file could be around 33 MB in size.

    4. Similarly, consider skipping the process of loading test
    result data into memory.

    5. In a separate script, compare the speed of (1) loading items
    into a vector of values, then passing them by value; (2) loading
    items into a vector of values, then passing them by reference
    (your current approach); (3) loading items into a vector of
    unique pointers to values, then passing them by reference or
    by value; and (4) creating a unique pointer to a vector, then
    loading items into it. (You could have a simulated dataset of
    1 million rows with 1,000 columns each, then add each row's
    columns together.)

    6. Get Alt + Enter to work when no space is present (eg for the
    very first word in the response). (You could
    just have this command reset the display in this situation.)

    7. Update Readme with gameplay + compilation information.

    9. (Maybe) find a way to allow for spaces in tags.
