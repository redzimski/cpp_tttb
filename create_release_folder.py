# # Script for creating folders that can store Linux, Windows, and Mac TTTB releases
# 
# By Ken Burchfiel
# 
# Released under the MIT License
# 
# This script makes it easier to quickly and accurately copy the files needed for a TTTB release into a folder that can then get zipped and uploaded to itch.io. You can also use it to create executable versions of the tttb.cpp and/or tttb_py_complement.py files; see argument parsing code below for more details.
# 
# (Note: Before running this code, make sure that the latest copy of your Pyinstaller-based tttb_py_complement executable, along with its '_internal' folder (if applicable), have been moved from build/dist/tttb_py_complement to build/. Disregard this note if you're using this script to build that executable, though, as in that case this step will get taken care of automatically.)
# 
# Also note that, in order for this script to successfully build the Pyinstaller executable, your base Python environment (and not just the environment from which you're calling this script) *may* need to have relatively recent versions of Numpy, Pandas, and Plotly.

# 
# NOTE: if you have trouble getting this code to run, make sure that you have pyinstaller added as a library within (1) the Python environment you're using to run this code and/or your base environment.
