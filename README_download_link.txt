The latest copy of the README (which includes gameplay instructions) can be found at https://github.com/kburchfiel/cpp_tttb/blob/main/README.pdf . Make sure to download and review it before playing the game. (If this link doesn't work, you should also be able to find the README.pdf file at https://kburchfiel.itch.io/tttb-cpp ; however, it's possible that this version won't be as up to date as the GitHub-hosted one.)
